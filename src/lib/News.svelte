	The block part was a huge success! The kids enjoyed the jump castle, games, pizza, and ice cream.
	Special thanks to everyone who suppoert this event from setup, to buying and preparing food, those
	who slaved over the frills to cook the hamburgers and hot dogs, the servers, and the clean-up
	crew. It takes a villiage and we appreciate the help.

<h1>🙏 Keep Otranto Beautiful 🗑️</h1>

<p>
	If youy see litter in yoru yard or on the side of the street, please pick it up and properly
	dispose of it. Unfortunatly, litter frequently goes into storm drains and ends up in the
	Reservoir. So, we need your help to keep the Reservoir clean adn safe for the waterfowl and
	coastal birds. Also, if you are a dog walker, please pickup after your pet adn put the waste in
	your trash bin.
